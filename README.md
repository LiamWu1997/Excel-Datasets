## 1. IESO Canada Ontario Energy Demand Datasets Compiled - marketdemand_on_2002-2021.csv
IESO Canda publishes energy demand data on their website, I've compiled/reorganized these into one single Excel file using PowerQuery and reformatted the strings in order to make it easier to perform Python data analysis.
